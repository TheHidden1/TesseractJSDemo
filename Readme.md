# TesseractJS

this a sample app that implement Tesseract.js in the task of extracting meaningful information from bill & receipts, this very basic and works as a proof of concept rather than a fully fledged implemetation 


# Installation 

### basic
```bash
> npm i 
> npm run start
```
### if you want a custom build of tesseract.js
```bash
> cd tesseract.js
> npm i
> cd ../
> npm run build-tesseract
> npm run start 
```
Then you should go to [http://localhost:5000/app](http://localhost:5000/app)
